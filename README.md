# Ziva: Event Management System (Frontend)

This is the **frontend client** for the **Ziva Event Management System**, a web application that allows users to explore, create, and manage events. The frontend communicates with a backend API to provide features like user authentication, event creation, and registration management.

The project is built using **Next.js (App Router)**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, following a feature-based architecture for maintainability and scalability.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login using email/password.
- **Event Dashboard**: View a list of upcoming events with details such as date, location, and available spots.
- **Event Creation & Management**: Authenticated users can create, update, and delete their own events.
- **One-Click Registration**: Users can register for an event or cancel existing registrations easily.
- **Personalized Registration Hub**: Dedicated page to view and manage all registrations of the logged-in user.
- **Capacity Management**: Displays available spots and prevents registrations for full events.
- **Protected Routes**: Only authenticated users can access certain pages and perform specific actions.
- **Form Validation & Error Handling**: Prevents invalid data submissions and handles API errors gracefully.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Libraries

- **Framework**: [Next.js 14+ (App Router)](https://nextjs.org/)  
- **Language**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)  
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)  
- **API Requests**: Native `fetch` API (or can switch to Axios)  
- **State Management**: React Context + Custom Hooks (`useAuth`, `useEvents`)  
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation before submitting to backend  
- **Linting & Formatting**: ESLint + Prettier for consistent code style

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design Decisions

- **Feature-Based Organization**: Components, hooks, and pages are grouped by feature (`auth`, `events`, `registrations`) instead of type, which improves maintainability.  
- **Next.js App Router**: Leverages nested layouts, route groups, and server components for faster loading and clean organization.  
- **Custom Hooks for State**: `useAuth` manages authentication state, while `useEvents` handles event data fetching and manipulation.  
- **Centralized API Layer**: All backend interactions are handled in `lib/api.ts` for consistent API calls and token management.  
- **Type Safety with TypeScript**: All components, hooks, and API responses are strongly typed to reduce runtime errors.

## üîó API Integration

* Base URL: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (from `.env.local`)
* All requests are made via `fetch` wrapped in `lib/api.ts`
* Authentication is handled via JWT stored in cookies

Example request in `lib/api.ts`:

```ts
export async function fetchEvents() {
  const res = await fetch(`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL}/events`, {
    credentials: "include",
  });
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error("Failed to fetch events");
  return res.json();
}
```

---

## üìù Notes & Recommendations

* Form validation is implemented on the client side for better UX.
* Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to `/login`.
* Can be extended with UI libraries like **ShadCN**, **Radix**, or **Material UI** for a more polished look.
* Ready for deployment on **Vercel** or any static hosting provider.
